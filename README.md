Gold Price Prediction with LSTM Model
This repository contains Python code for predicting the price of gold using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequence prediction tasks, making it a suitable choice for time series forecasting, such as predicting the price of gold.

Description
Gold price prediction is a challenging yet crucial task for investors, traders, and financial analysts. By leveraging historical gold price data, machine learning models like LSTM can learn complex patterns and relationships in the time series data, enabling them to make accurate predictions about future gold prices.

LSTM Model
The LSTM model used in this repository is a type of artificial neural network that can process and predict time series data with long-term dependencies. Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, LSTM networks have memory cells that allow them to retain information over time, making them particularly effective for time series forecasting tasks.

Usage
To use the LSTM model for gold price prediction, simply provide historical gold price data as input to the model. The model will learn from the historical data to make predictions about future gold prices. You can fine-tune the model architecture, hyperparameters, and training settings to optimize its performance for your specific prediction task.
